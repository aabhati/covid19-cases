# Corona Cases Prediction


Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new virus disease caused by inflammation. The illness induced respiratory problems (such as influenza) with symptoms such as cold , cough, and fever, and the difficulty of breathing in increasingly serious cases. In India, coronavirus outbreak as disturbed the workings of life as a whole. 
We have a dataset related to current  pandemic(covid-19). Now we have to filtrate the dataset and predict total cases in India in upcoming days. 
In below sheet we show how we use the dataset and filtrate it for doing prediction.

In this we use two Algorithm for covid prediction in India using machine learning Random Forest Regression Algorithm. Linear Regression is, in statistics, a straightforward way of showing the relation between a dependent variable and at least one independent variable. Linear regression was the principal form of regression analysis to be extensively concentrated and commonly used in useful applications
Role of Machine Learning to Predict the Outbreak of Covid-19 in India and MACHINE LEARNING PREDICTION FOR COVID 19 PANDEMIC IN INDIA is being implement by Random Forest Regression using Machine Learning.
 Predicting the Outbreak of COVID-19 Pandemic using Machine Learning is best way to get the total no corona virus patient in india which we get in future. We can also predict total no deaths due to this corona virus by using the same Random Forest regression algorithm.
